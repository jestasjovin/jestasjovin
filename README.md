## **Technologies & Tools**

### **Frontend:**
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building fast, interactive UIs. I use **React** to develop highly dynamic and reusable components.
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and static web applications. Next.js is my go-to for building fast, SEO-friendly React applications.
- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile development with **React** for building seamless, native-like mobile apps for iOS and Android.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework that I use to design modern, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.
- **CSS3**: Used alongside Tailwind for custom styling to enhance user experience.
- **Redux**: State management library that helps me manage and share application state across components efficiently.
- **TypeScript**: I use **TypeScript** for type safety, ensuring better maintainability and fewer runtime errors in my projects.

### **Backend:**
- **Node.js**: I utilize **Node.js** for building fast and scalable server-side applications in JavaScript.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist framework that helps me quickly set up web servers and RESTful APIs.
- **NestJS**: A progressive framework for building efficient, scalable, and reliable server-side applications using **TypeScript**.
- **GraphQL**: Used for efficient and flexible querying of data, ensuring clients only get the data they need.
- **WebSockets**: I leverage **WebSockets** to build real-time features like chat systems, live notifications, or live updates.
- **REST API**: Creating robust, scalable RESTful APIs to serve as the backbone of web and mobile applications.

### **Database & ORM:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system known for its reliability, performance, and SQL compliance.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for handling large volumes of unstructured data. Ideal for building flexible, scalable applications.
- **SQL**: I have extensive experience with **SQL** for querying relational databases.
- **TypeORM**: TypeScript ORM that allows me to interact with SQL databases in a type-safe way.
- **Sequelize**: ORM for Node.js for working with databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
- **Prisma**: Next-generation ORM for Node.js, providing a powerful tool to manage database schemas and queries with type safety.

### **Cloud & Infrastructure:**
- **AWS**: I use **Amazon Web Services** to deploy, manage, and scale applications in the cloud.
- **Docker**: For containerizing applications, ensuring consistency across different environments, and simplifying deployment.
- **HTTPS**: Ensuring secure communication over the web by implementing **SSL/TLS** certificates in all my applications.

### **Microservices & Distributed Systems:**
- **Microservices Architecture**: I build systems using microservices for scalability, fault isolation, and better management of large applications.
- **Linux**: Linux is my preferred operating system for development and deployment, offering powerful command-line tools and flexibility.

### **Data Structures & Algorithms:**
- I have strong expertise in **Data Structures** like **arrays**, **linked lists**, **trees**, **graphs**, **hashmaps**, and others, which I apply in solving complex coding problems.
- Proficient in **Algorithms** like **sorting**, **searching**, **dynamic programming**, and **graph algorithms** to optimize application performance.

### **AI/ML and Deep Learning Basics:**
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Basics of AI algorithms such as **classification**, **clustering**, and **regression**.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Working knowledge of supervised and unsupervised learning, with experience in implementing simple models.
- **Deep Learning**: Familiar with foundational concepts in deep learning like **neural networks**, **backpropagation**, and **training models**.
